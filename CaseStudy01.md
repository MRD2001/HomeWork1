### Chime Performance

>Just 8% of US consumers consider an online bank like Chime or Varo their primary bank (Observation made by FinTech Snark Tank). But among consumers with two accounts, digital banks have a 14% market share, and of Americans with three accounts, they’ve captured 17% of the pie. All told, consumers have 27 million accounts opened with online banks. Chime has a 35% share of all digital banks checking accounts. The next biggest competitors are Ally Bank with 9% of the digital banking market, and Varo Money with 6% share.Chime has done an amazing job at customer acquisition and dominates the digital bank space.  
But, there are 3 looming threats to the growth to Chime and other FinTech Companies: 
- Emerging niche digital banks : Chime and Varo have been battling it out for the low- to middle-income consumer segment in the digital banking space, but as players like First Boulevard, OurBanc, and Greenwood gain traction in the African-American community they’ll stunt Chime’s growth. Other niche neobanks will also chip away at both Chime’s existing and potential customer base. Translation: Chime’s hockey stick growth curve may be upside down.
- Wallmart : Low- to middle-income consumers comprise Walmart’s core customer base. The retailer’s existing financial service offerings clearly haven’t stunted Chime’s growth. The big unknown is what Walmart’s fintech plans are. My hypothesis is that Walmart wants to build a super app that would bundle a wide range of services, not just retail and financial. If Chime’s plan is to expand beyond financial products (like Revolut with its travel agency), it better get a move on if it hasn’t done so already.
- Square : From a demographic perspective, Square Cash App users look a lot like Chime’s customers. With its seller ecosystem services, Square Capital, and now a business checking account, Square has created a business model that goes well beyond just making money on interchange. With its crypto services and the acquisition of Tidal, Square has diversified its revenue sources from its consumer base.
