The following are the number of customers Chime have and the growth presented over the years. As it provides more than just mobile banking experience to its customers. Chime competes with a “featurization” strategy. The fintech certainly offers a good mobile user experience and touts no fees to attract low- to middle-income consumers.While Chime has grown its overall customer base, the percentage of Gen Zers that consider Chime their primary checking account provider declined between October 2020 and July 2021 according to two Cornerstone Advisors consumer studies.

### Chime Features

>Chime is using so many advantages, onstage and backstage, to further leverage their offerings and improve their product attractiveness to the customers. The unfair advantage that Chime utilise to compete is the service of overdraft protection called **SpotMe**  and their early deposit system which allows customers to get their paycheck up to two days early. ... Chime's current success comes from its mobile friendly approach to banking that appeals to cash-strapped millennials. the other feature that Chime have and give them leverage on top of its competition is **Credit-builder credit card** Chime’s predominantly low- to middle-income consumers aren’t in the crosshairs of the big credit card issuers’ marketing efforts.

### Trends of OnLine Banking
 
>Online Banking was first adopted in New York in 1981 where the major banks like Citibank, Chase and others provided home banking services by making use of a system called videotext. Stanford Federal Credit Union was the first service provider of internet banking in October 1994. The Digital Banking and FinTech in general have begun developing on a lrager scale after 2007 financial crisis, which caused a decline in confidence in traditional financial institutions. Since then, the sector has grown to be one of the most competitive industries, thanks to (but not limited to) new technologies that allowed many businesses to gain a competitive advantage: Blockchain, AI, biometric indication, RPA, big data, new payment methods, infrastructure-based technologies, and others.
Chime apply these cutting-edge technologies to improve existing financial services or create new ones, the following trends adopted by Chime, alongside by other digital banking providers:

- Growth of online transactions : people more often choose it over offline payments and trips to brick-and-mortar stores.Besides, during remote times, many have tried stock trading
- Simplified access to the banking products : Minimum time and effort are the top priority things for modern customers. With this in mind, banks are trying to simplify access to banking products and make the user experience as pleasant and seamless as possible.
- paperless documentation :Most modern banks allow customers to open accounts, pay taxes, and carry out other financial transactions without leaving online banking. In this regard, digital electronic signatures, security tools, and biometrics systems are actively developing. This situation shapes future trends in mobile banking, forcing financial institutions to pay more attention to cybersecurity and customer data protection.
- AI and ML usage : Artificial Intelligence and ML are not a new technology now and we see its applications across our lives, not only in financial services. 
 -   marketing and sales: lead scoring, cross-selling, personal offers, targeting
  -  customer service: chatbots, voice bots, checking client documents
  - back-office processes: risk management, intelligent processing of documentation
- Data-driven approach : In 2021 , banks build a smarter ways to use collected data through logical data structuring and extracting meaningful pieces of information. Like drawing up a certain pattern manifisted by the customer behaviour, which allows more personalised targeted marketing. The revolution of **Big Data** from online baning, ATM machines, Mobile APPs, Call centers, and the branches. 
- Cloud technologies : this specific trend of technological advancement is the most important factor for the rise of FinTech and the establishment of better, simpler and cheaper ways to manage our finances. Cloud services are becoming a hot trend in digital banking innovation. They allow you to launch financial services faster and quickly scale them on-demand. Organizations save time and money by working in the cloud because they don’t have to deploy IT infrastructure on-premise. Cloud providers supply developers with all the necessary tools, including server space, AI/ML technologies, backup/restore functions, etc. This makes development faster and more efficient. And when the business starts to grow, you can easily adapt to its changing needs by purchasing the necessary resources.

### Chime Performance

>Just 8% of US consumers consider an online bank like Chime or Varo their primary bank (Observation made by FinTech Snark Tank). But among consumers with two accounts, digital banks have a 14% market share, and of Americans with three accounts, they’ve captured 17% of the pie. All told, consumers have 27 million accounts opened with online banks. Chime has a 35% share of all digital banks checking accounts. The next biggest competitors are Ally Bank with 9% of the digital banking market, and Varo Money with 6% share.Chime has done an amazing job at customer acquisition and dominates the digital bank space.  
But, **there are 3 looming threats to the growth to Chime and other FinTech Companies**: 
- Emerging niche digital banks : Chime and Varo have been battling it out for the low- to middle-income consumer segment in the digital banking space, but as players like First Boulevard, OurBanc, and Greenwood gain traction in the African-American community they’ll stunt Chime’s growth. Other niche neobanks will also chip away at both Chime’s existing and potential customer base. Translation: Chime’s hockey stick growth curve may be upside down.
- Wallmart : Low- to middle-income consumers comprise Walmart’s core customer base. The retailer’s existing financial service offerings clearly haven’t stunted Chime’s growth. The big unknown is what Walmart’s fintech plans are. My hypothesis is that Walmart wants to build a super app that would bundle a wide range of services, not just retail and financial. If Chime’s plan is to expand beyond financial products (like Revolut with its travel agency), it better get a move on if it hasn’t done so already.
- Square : From a demographic perspective, Square Cash App users look a lot like Chime’s customers. With its seller ecosystem services, Square Capital, and now a business checking account, Square has created a business model that goes well beyond just making money on interchange. With its crypto services and the acquisition of Tidal, Square has diversified its revenue sources from its consumer base.


## Recommendations

> It has been mentioned in multiple occussions that there are issues or limitation in the customers onboarding to the chime APP. Some negative reviews and feedback coming from customers trying to register in some blogs. So, I would adivse to put an extra attention to the onboarding process, especially chime is a digital bank and does not have a branch where customers can walk into and ask for an advice.chime needs to rely on technology to attend customer service issues and to find oppurtunities in customers needs to create new services.

> The company can utilise **AI/ML** and create **cognitive AI** to enhance the perosnalisation and streamline the onboaridng further.This technology will improve the customer service, as people still seek human interaction to ask or solve their problems, with better AI and conversational BOTs, chime can reach to a human-like interaction with the customers which will put them at ease. 

AI encompasses, among other things, cognitive automation, cognitive engagement, and cognitive insights:
- Cognitive automation : Enable machines to replicate human actions and judgment with robotics and cognitive technologies'
- Cognitive engagement :Use intelligent agents and avatars to deliver mass consumer personalization at scale and smarter, more relevant insights to amplify end user experience
- Cognitive insights : Employ data science and machine learning to detect critical patterns, make high-quality predictions, and support business performance

> Thanks to cognitive intelligence, AI-powered systems are able to mimic some aspects of human intellect by :
-recognising and understanding elements for which they are programed. This is the first step of cognitive Al. For example, syntax of a text, shapes in handwritten text, figures or faces on an image or a video, syntax of voice, and much more.
- Applying context and interactions - The capacity to represent links between different pieces of information. For example: “Bob is a dog. Dogs are animals. Dogs hate cats.”
- Reasoning and making decisions - Consists of interpreting the information recognized, possibly by making links with context. Then, decisions are made based on AI insights.
- Identify semantics - Reasoning and making decisions also works as an enabler to identify the meaning of information recognized. For example, the sentence “I am going to the bank” can have two meanings (the establishment or the riverbank), it is necessary to know the context and to make a link to better understand the meaning of this sentence.
- Learning and improving - The last and most crucial step of cognitive AI is the function of learning from the data provided, but also from mistakes in order to self-improve. This capacity is referred to as machine learning.

>The proper and carefull implementation of cognitive AI, will increase the acqusition rates, and reduce the customer churn, hence encourage the customers to use their services which means more swipes and more reveneue to the company. **Customer service** is one of the most prominent areas of FinTech that has been improved by artificial intelligence. The increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence has resulted in chatbot, virtual helpers  and artificial intelligence interfaces that can reliably interact with customers. The ability to answer basic queries offers massive potential in reducing front office and helpline costs.In addition to that **AI Provides Analytics and Insights**; In conjunction with quick decision making, AI offers chime game-changing insights which are key in the FinTech sector that is so heavily reliant on gathering and processing customer data. Not only does this empower Chime, but it empowers their customers as well. Chime can give customers insight into their own spending based on income, expenditure and spending habits, ultimately providing a new method of personalised financial management.
